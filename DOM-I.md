# Introduction to the DOM

1. What is the DOM?
  * It is the Document Object Model
  * An object representation of the HTML elements of a webpage. 
  * It is *NOT* the HTML page itself. 
  * The DOM is an Application Programming Interface (API). In our case, the DOM is a bridge between Content and the browser. 
    ** Content -- DOM --> Browser
2. What the DOM is *NOT*:
  * JavaScript
  * HTML or CSS
  * Static - "Static" doesn't change or do anything
3. What the DOM *IS*:
  * Language-Neutral API - This means JavaScript is not the *only* language that can actually manipulate it
  * Tree-like structure representing your content, structure, and style
  * Dynamic - meaning, if we change it live, it changes right before our eyes. 
  * Document (Node Element)
